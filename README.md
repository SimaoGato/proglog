# ProgLog

## Overview
Welcome to ProgLog, a project inspired by "Distributed Services with Go: Your Guide to Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems" by Travis Jeffery. This README provides essential information on using and understanding the project.

## Usage
Right now, I am on chapter 2, so the only command needed is to:
```s
make compile
```
on the main directory.
